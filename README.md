![Graphical abstract](assets/img/darkowlus-desktop.png "Example macOS High Sierra desktop in the daytime and in the nighttime")

Automatically darkens macOS appearance and desktop picture in the nighttime.
Runs, e.g., on my Mac mini 2010 with macOS High Sierra.

# Getting started

To create an application from `darkowlus.applescript`, open it in Script-Editor,
set your location, and export the modified script as stay-open application. Put
the application into the `darkowlus` folder. Then put arbitrary desktop pictures
`Daytime.jpg` and `Nighttime.jpg` into that folder, too, and run the application
you created.

# Thanks

This software uses [sunrise-sunset.org](https://sunrise-sunset.org) API and
